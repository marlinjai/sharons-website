## ðŸ”§ **Additional Steps to Improve Deliverability**

### **1. Domain Authentication (Critical)**
Set up these DNS records for `returnhypnosis.com`:

**SPF Record:**
```
TXT: v=spf1 include:_spf.resend.com ~all
```

**DKIM Record:**
```
TXT: resend._domainkey IN TXT "p=MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQC..."
```

**DMARC Record:**
```
TXT: v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:hello@returnhypnosis.com
```

### **2. Warm Up Your Domain**
- Start with small volumes (10-20 emails/day)
- Gradually increase over 2-4 weeks
- Monitor bounce rates and spam complaints
- Encourage recipients to add you to contacts

### **3. List Hygiene**
- Remove bounced emails immediately
- Monitor unsubscribe requests
- Avoid purchased email lists
- Use double opt-in for subscriptions

### **4. Content Guidelines**
- Avoid spam trigger words: "FREE!", "URGENT!", excessive caps
- Keep image-to-text ratio balanced (more text than images)
- Use consistent "From" name and email
- Include physical address (business address)

### **5. Engagement Tracking**
